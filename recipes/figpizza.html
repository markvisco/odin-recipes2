    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of lukewarm water</li>
            <li>.25 ounce of active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 cups of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>8 dried figs</li>
            <li>1 medium red onion, thinly slced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of dried thyme</li>
            <li>4 ounces of goat cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>    
        <ol>
            <li>Pour water into a large bowl and sprinkle yeast over top. Let stand for a few minutes to dissolve. Mix in oil, salt, and flour to make a dough. <br>When dough is too stiff to stir, turn out onto a floured surface, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place into an oiled bowl, and cover with a clean towel. Set aside to rise for about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place figs into a small bowl, and pour boiling water over them. Let stand for about 10 minutes, then drain and chop. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until they are wilted and soft. <br>Reduce heat to low, and season with salt. Continue to cook and stir until onions are dark brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in thyme, fennel seed, and figs, and remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Punch down pizza dough, and stretch into a circle about 1/4-inch thick. Place on a lightly greased pizza pan or baking sheet. <br>Brush surface lightly with remaining olive oil. Spread onion and fig mixture over crust. It will be sparse, but there is plenty of flavor. Dot with pieces of goat cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until crust has turned golden brown at edges.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
