    <h2>Description!</h2>
        <p>A delicious traditional Greek pie made with a filling of spinach, feta cheese, and herbs, 
        baked in layers of thin phyllo dough. <br>It's a popular and versatile dish, often 
        served as an appetizer, snack, or light meal</p>
    <p>Spanakopita makes a great side dish for large holiday dinners next to lamb or lemon chicken. 
        But it can easily stand alone as the main dish. <br>Serve it with a big salad like Greek salad; 
        Balela; or this Mediterranean chickpea salad, and favorite dips like Greek Tzatziki or 
        Roasted Garlic Hummus.</p>    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh spinach</li>
            <li>12 eggs</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>6 slices of bacon, chopped </li>
            <li>1/2 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>3 ounces of crumbled feta cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Heat butter in a large oven-safe skillet over high heat. Toss spinach in hot butter until wilted, about 30 seconds. Drain spinach well and squeeze it as dry as possible. Transfer to a cutting board and chop.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a bowl with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Place bacon in the same skillet used to cook spinach and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until bacon has rendered its fat and is almost crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. <br>Use a paper towel held in a tongs to remove excess bacon grease. Reduce heat to medium; saute onion with bacon and a pinch of salt until onion is translucent, about 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Saute chopped spinach with bacon and onion until spinach is hot; pour in eggs. Use a wooden spoon to distribute spinach evenly throughout the eggs. Sprinkle feta cheese over mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, 10 to 15 minutes. Top may still be a little wet.</li>
            <li>Turn on oven's broiler. Broil pie until top is lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
